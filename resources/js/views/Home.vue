            <p class="align-middle" style="height: 100%">We are all too familiar with the classic game of Duck, Duck, Goose! Playing it as a child, always hoping that you would finally be picked as the goose. Well today is the day that we all get that chance. We present to you: Duck, Duck, Goose! on the blockchain! Never before have you had this much fun with an NFT. Every goose is a winner!</p>

When enough eggs are minted, they all hatch, revealing a bunch of ducks and one goose! The lucky parent of the goose gets rewarded with a special prize, and then the cycle starts all over again.</p>

In order to keep things fun in perpetuity, whenever the hatch cycle grows to a certain size, it resets back to the beginning and we can start all over again!</p>

            <p class="align-middle" style="height: 100%">The starting hatch cycle is set to 5. This means that 5 eggs need to be minted before they can hatch. After a hatch cycle completes, the cycle is incrementing by "1" (e.g. 5 turns into 6, 6 into 7, etc). In each hatch cycle, there will be only one goose. The lucky parent of that goose will receive 90% of the contract balance! As the hatch cycles get bigger, so do the rewards! Eventually, when the hatch cycle reaches the maximum of 500, it will reset back to 5 so the game can start all over again.</p>
